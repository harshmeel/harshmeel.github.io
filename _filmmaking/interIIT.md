## Inter IIT Filmmaking Cup 2023

### Online Short Film Making

Description: After a grueling two-year COVID-induced hiatus, Inter IIT was finally back in action during my fourth year. Picture this: a bunch of film buffs, clueless about filmmaking, and without a 'senior' to show us the ropes (apparently, I was now the 'senior', who had never shot a Inter IIT Film before), decided to take the plunge. I picked up the camera, thinking I'd learn as I go, but guess what? I ended up leading the entire cinematography gig!

For a solid month, we scoured locations, brainstormed themes, and assembled the most 'cool yet amateur' crew you could imagine and shot a mystical 1950s Bombay slum story - "Narsimha" . But you know what? We pulled it off! This put me in love with film-making.

### 51 hours Filmmaking

Description: Right after our online film journey, we dashed off to IIT Madras for a whirlwind adventure: the 51-hour film challenge. Here's the deal â€“ you get a theme one fine morning, and then you've got just 51 hours to dream it up, shoot it, edit it, and submit a short film. No rules, except you're stuck with your crew.

Our gang? A bunch of students handpicked from our last film, "Narsimha." The theme was "Superpower for a day." We hit the Chennai streets, even had a run-in with the local police, and after two wild days, we birthed this comedic piece - "CHOR" .

Guess what? It scored us a gleaming gold at the event and, paired with our online film, we swept the FILM CUP at Inter IIT. A bunch of rookies just breathed life back into the IITB film society post-COVID!
