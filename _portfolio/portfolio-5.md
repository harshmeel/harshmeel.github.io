In my critique, I explore two influential documentaries on climate change - [An Inconvenient Truth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/) and [The Great Global Warming Swindle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020027/) .I chose these films for their contrasting perspectives; one is alarmist, and the other is so skeptical it denies the former. My focus is on dissecting their arguments, assessing their scientific accuracy, and highlighting how they are trying to shape public perception. This analysis emphasizes the importance of evaluating smartly shrouded facts for or against complex scientific propositions like Anthropogenic Climate Change. Through this work, I aim to contribute to a more informed and balanced public discourse on climate change.
