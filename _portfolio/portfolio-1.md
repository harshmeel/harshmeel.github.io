title: "Design of Lithium-Ion Battery for Formula Student Electric"
excerpt: >
    Harsh Meel, M Danish

    In my third year of Undergrad, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/). The team builds a battery-run formula-style car from scratch in a year and competes at Formula Student UK, an international student competition, where we won the Design Event in 2021.

I had inherited a pretty good and reliable battery design from my predecessor. In my junior year, I had discussed with my previous DE that a parallel configuration, though pretty complex, would be a great improvement on current battery.
In my tenure, we had to order new set of cells for the battery, and I along with my co-Design Engineer [M Danish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danish-m-444848198/) decided this was a great oppurtunity to design IIT Bombay Racing's first parallel configuration Battery.
