title: "Design of Lithium-Ion Battery for Formula Student Electric"
excerpt: "Harsh Meel, M Danish"<br/>"In my third year of Undergrad, I worked in capacity of Mechanical Design Engineer for [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/). The team builds a battery run fomula style car from scratch in a year and runs it at Formula Student UK, a international student competition, where we Won in Design Event 2021.

I had chosen the Battery subsystem as my area of focus in the team for resons including:
1. It was at the intersection of electrical and mechanical systems of the car, giving me a wide area of engineering to play with.
2. Battery subsystem had a big order coming up. There was a potential to improve a lot and thus, A LOT OF POTENTIAL SPACE TO TINKER.

I inherited a pretty good and reliable battery design from my predecessor. In my junior year, I had discussed with my previous DE that a parallel configuration, though pretty complex, would be a great improvement on current battery.
In my tenure, we had to order new set of cells for the battery, and I along with my co-Design Engineer [M Danish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danish-m-444848198/) decided this was a great oppurtunity to design IIT Bombay Racing's first parallel configuration Battery.
