In the context of Formula Student competition, accurately sizing the battery for optimal performance is paramount. Our project seamlessly integrates computer simulations with real-world driver behaviors to determine the energy needs of our car. While simulations yield high-energy demands for peak speed, this doesn't align with practical driver capabilities. To strike the right balance, we devised a novel approach. Leveraging driver data we collected from go-karting laps and calculating a unique driver factor of Aggression, we harmonize simulation outputs with real-life performance. This innovative methodology yields precise estimations, ensuring our vehicle's energy reserves align with both theoretical potential and realistic on-track usage.
