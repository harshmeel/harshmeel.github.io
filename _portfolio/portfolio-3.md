excerpt: "Harsh Meel, M Danish - In my third year of Undergrad, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/). The team builds a battery-run formula-style car from scratch in a year and competes at Formula Student UK, an international student competition, where we won the Design Event in 2021."

I had chosen the Battery subsystem as my area of focus in the team for reasons including:

1. It was at the intersection of electrical and mechanical systems of the car, giving me a wide area of engineering to play with.
2. Battery subsystem had a big order coming up. There was a potential to improve a lot and thus, A LOT OF POTENTIAL SPACE TO TINKER.

I inherited a pretty good and reliable battery design from my predecessor. In my junior year, I had discussed with my previous Design Engineer that a parallel configuration, though pretty complex, would be a great improvement on the current battery.

In my tenure, we had to order a new set of cells for the battery, and I, along with my co-Design Engineer [M Danish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danish-m-444848198/), decided this was a great opportunity to design IIT Bombay Racing's first parallel configuration Battery.
