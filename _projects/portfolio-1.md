    In my third year of Undergrad, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/). The team builds a battery-run formula-style car from scratch in a year and competes at Formula Student UK, an international student competition, where we won the Design Event in 2021.<br/>

This entry illuminates my contribution to IIT Bombay Racing, where I spearheaded the evolution from an existing battery design to a complex parallel configuration of cells. Collaborating with M Danish, we capitalized on a plan for new battery cell set acquisition. Navigating intricate challenges, we achieved remarkable results, notably significantly lowering battery pack heat generation based on the design (theoretical value of 50%) and compacting the pack volume by nearly one-third. This accomplishment underscores our commitment to intricate problem-solving and innovation and our team's dedication to advancing sustainable automotive technologies on both the theoretical and practical fronts.
