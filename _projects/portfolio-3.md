   In my last semester at IITB, I undertook this study of optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure along a pivotal Indian highway. Originating from my BTech Technical Project, this study leverages Optimization theory and established methodologies to formulate an efficient EV charging framework for the Mumbai-Pune route.This project ignited my interest in the realm of optimization research and computing.<br/>

This report delves into a comprehensive analysis of optimizing battery electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure along an Indian highway corridor. With EVs gaining prominence as an alternative to traditional cars, inadequate infrastructure has hindered their adoption. This study focuses on developing an optimal charging setup to minimize travel and charging delays while ensuring economic feasibility. Industry consultations with Tata Motors and Exponent Energy refined the problem statement, emphasizing optimal charger placement. The research begins with a simplified model for a single corridor, optimizing battery range and charger power to minimize costs and enhance service. Results highlight the importance of Level 3 DC fast charging infrastructure and its cost-effectiveness in improving the EV charging landscape.
