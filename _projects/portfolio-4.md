  In the summer of 2020, during our first year of undergrad, we embarked on a project to enhance road safety.Our objective was to counter the prevalent issue of accidents arising from ill-timed overtaking maneuvers.We conceived a driver-assist system tailored to address this concern. The project's success was underscored by a special mention from the Institute Technical Council at IIT Bombay.<br/>

Here is a short video giving a quick glimpse to our Summer Project. It was a fun activity in the COVID lockdown, giving us a much needed break!
