### Ooty Travel Diary - Noir era film test

So I graduated from IIT Bombay and now had to figure out what to do with my love for filmmaking, cinema, and cinematography skills, with no crew around to work with anymore. After many months of head scratching came the genius idea of creating a YouTube channel ( soo ORIGIIINALLL Harsh uWu)  
Given my habit of delaying projects in an attempt to come up with the perfect script and edit, and never being successful at that, I called the channel " imperfectionicts | ‡§Ö‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ " ( basically the Hindi translation of the same word). Our first video is a travel diary shot in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. I took some sexy men from Bengaluru to pose for the shots too :P. Also, they gave me some emotional company. See the YouTube video description if you still need more of my lore.

## Inter IIT Filmmaking Cup 2023

### Online Short Film Making

After a grueling two-year COVID-induced hiatus, Inter IIT was finally back in action during my fourth year. Picture this: a bunch of film buffs, clueless about filmmaking, and without a 'senior' to show us the ropes (apparently, I was now the 'senior', who had never shot a Inter IIT Film before), decided to take the plunge. I picked up the camera, thinking I'd learn as I go, but guess what? I ended up leading the entire cinematography gig!

For a solid month, we scoured locations, brainstormed themes, and assembled the most 'cool yet amateur' crew you could imagine and shot a mystical 1950s Bombay slum story - "Narsimha" . But you know what? We pulled it off! This put me in love with film-making.

### 51 hours Filmmaking

Right after our online film journey, we dashed off to IIT Madras for a whirlwind adventure: the 51-hour film challenge. Here's the deal ‚Äì you get a theme one fine morning, and then you've got just 51 hours to dream it up, shoot it, edit it, and submit a short film. No rules, except you're stuck with your crew.

Our gang? A bunch of students handpicked from our last film, "Narsimha." The theme was "Superpower for a day." We hit the Chennai streets, even had a run-in with the local police, and after two wild days, we birthed this comedic piece - "CHOR" .

Guess what? It scored us a gleaming gold at the event and, paired with our online film, we swept the FILM CUP at Inter IIT. A bunch of rookies just breathed life back into the IITB film society post-COVID!

## Music Video General Championship 2021-22

Music videos have always been a favorite of mine! Though I never picked up the skills to be a rockstar, music videos, and shooting concerts seem to be a way to be close to that magic. One of my earlier and amateur attempts at being the rockstar I never came to be was filming "To rid the disease." Brainchild of a genius called Bhagwan Dutt, who was always the highest in the room :P , this is a film made using four things:
1. A Oneplus Smartphone
2. A smartphone gimbal
3. One Aperture MC light
4. Bhagwan's *divine inspiration* 

The film got the best editing, but I am pretty sure the judge mistook cinematography for editing üòÑ .
