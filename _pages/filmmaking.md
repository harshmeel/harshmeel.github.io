### Ooty Travel Diary - Noir era film test

So I graduated from IIT Bombay and now had to figure out what to do with my love for filmmaking, cinema, and cinematography skills, with no crew around to work with anymore. After many months of head scratching came the genius idea of creating a YouTube channel.
Given my habit of delaying projects in an attempt to come up with the perfect script and edit, and never being successful at that, I called the channel " imperfectionicts | ‡§Ö‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ " ( basically the Hindi translation of the same word). Our first video is a travel diary shot in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. I took some charismatic men from Bengaluru to pose for the shots too :P. Also, they gave me some emotional company. See the YouTube video description if you still need more of my lore.

## Music Video General Championship 2021-22

Music videos have always been a favorite of mine! Though I never picked up the skills to be a rockstar, music videos, and shooting concerts seem to be a way to be close to that magic. One of my earlier and amateur attempts at being the rockstar I never came to be was filming "To rid the disease." Brainchild of a senior called Bhagwan Dutt, this is a film made using four things:
1. A Oneplus Smartphone
2. A smartphone gimbal
3. One Aperture MC light
4. Bhagwan's *divine inspiration* 

The film got the best editing, but I am pretty sure the judge mistook cinematography for editing üòÑ .
