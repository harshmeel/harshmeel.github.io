🧑‍💻 I am a first-year MS student in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca. I am member of the [Climate Engineering](https://climate-engineering.mae.cornell.edu/) group at Cornell Engineering under Prof. Douglas MacMartin, researching Stratospheric Aerosol Injection as a strategy to fight climate change. I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay, India in 2023, Majoring in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Mechanical Engineering.

🧐 I am passionate about creating a sustainable, carbon-free future that supports economic growth, prosperity, and equity. Utilizing my engineering expertise, I am working on projects aimed at preventing and adapting to anthropogenic climate change.

🔬 My previous work have span areas of Mechanical Design, Optimization Research, Probabilistic Modelling, and Analysis. My skills have evolved from product design to computing and analysis lately. I love to work on hands-on problems, for feedback from the real world keeps me amazed and ever curious.    

🏎️ Apart from academia, I have been involved in Formula Student, Film-making, and going on adventures. I love to travel with my mirrorless camera to capture shots and make cinematic travel diaries.

🪴 I am from a town called Jhunjhunu, situated near Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, and I live in Ithaca, United States.
