🧑‍💻 I am a second-year MS student in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca. I am member of the [Climate Engineering](https://climate-engineering.mae.cornell.edu/) group at Cornell Engineering under Prof. Douglas MacMartin, researching Stratospheric Aerosol Injection as a strategy to manage climate change. I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay, India in 2023, Majoring in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Mechanical Engineering.

🧐 I am passionate about helping create a sustainable, comfortable and resilient climate that allows human prosperity, and equity. Currently, I am doing my research in geoengineering. This field explores last-resort solutions to temporarily stabilize Earth's climate if we fall short of managing our emissions before the adverse effects start kicking in. My focus is on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection.

🔬 My previous work have span areas of Mechanical Design to Modelling, and Analysis. My skills have evolved from product design to computing and analysis lately. I love to work on hands-on problems, for feedback from the real world keeps me curious and humble!   

🪴 I was born in a small town called Jhunjhunu, situated near Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, and I live in Ithaca, United States.
