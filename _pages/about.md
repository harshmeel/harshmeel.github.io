🧑‍💻 I am a second-year MS student in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca. I am a member of the [Climate Engineering](https://climate-engineering.mae.cornell.edu/) group at Cornell Engineering under Prof. Douglas MacMartin, focusing on the use of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as a temporary method to tackle the problems of global climate change. I completed my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, India, in 2023, Majoring in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Mechanical Engineering.

🧐 I intend to work for a sustainable, comfortable and resilient environment and climate that is conducive to an effort of prosperity and equity by one and all. My MS thesis work focuses on understanding the impacts of SAI on the Indian Monsoon and designing feedback control strategies to mitigate the risk of a significant shift in the monsoon precipitation strength, in the context of a warmer world.

🔬 My work has spanned areas of mechanical design to system modeling , using skills from product design to computation and data analysis. I love to work on hands-on problems, for feedback from the real world keeps me curious and humble!     

🪴 I was born in the town of Jhunjhunu, located near Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, and I live in Ithaca, United States.
