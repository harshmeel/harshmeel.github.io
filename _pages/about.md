🧑‍💻 I am a Project Associate (Research Assistant) under [Prof. Ashutosh Mahajan](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/files/faculty/amahajan/) at IEOR, IIT Bombay. Merging my interest in Electric Mobility and Ashutosh's expertise in complex mathematical modeling and optimization, we are working to catalyze the switch to electric vehicles from carbon-emitting combustion cars by making the EV option competitive, if not better than the fuel-based option.

🎓 I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay in 2023, Majoring in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in Climate Change solutions, and my focus gravitates toward the subfields of electric mobility, energy storage, and optimizing clean energy infrastructure like vehicle charging.

🔬 My work have span areas of Mechanical Design, Optimization Research, Probabilistic Modelling, and Analysis. My skills have evolved from CAD and simulations to computing and analysis lately. I love to work on hands-on problems, for feedback from the real world keeps me amazed and ever curious.    

🏎️ Apart from academia, I have been involved in Formula Student, Film-making, and going on adventures. I love to travel with my mirrorless camera to capture shots and make cinematic travel diaries.

🪴 I am from a town called Jhunjhunu, situated near Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, and I live in Mumbai, India.
