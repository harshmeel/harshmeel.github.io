🧑‍💻 I am a first-year MS student in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca. I am studying and planning to (hopefully!) specialize in Energy and Sustainability. 

🎓 I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay in 2023, Majoring in Civil Engineering with a Minor in Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in Climate Change solutions, and my focus gravitates toward the subfields of electric mobility, energy storage, and optimizing clean energy infrastructure like vehicle charging.

🔬 My work have span areas of Mechanical Design, Optimization Research, Probabilistic Modelling, and Analysis. My skills have evolved from CAD and simulations to computing and analysis lately. I love to work on hands-on problems, for feedback from the real world keeps me amazed and ever curious.    

🏎️ Apart from academia, I have been involved in Formula Student, Film-making, and going on adventures. I love to travel with my mirrorless camera to capture shots and make cinematic travel diaries.

🪴 I am from a town called Jhunjhunu, situated near Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, and I live in Ithaca, United States.
